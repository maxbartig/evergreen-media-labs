# Evergreen Media Labs Autonomous Outreach System

## Purpose
This system is an autonomous lead generation and outreach engine for Evergreen Media Labs. It:

- finds local businesses without websites
- stores leads in Google Sheets CRM
- generates personalized draft outreach emails
- supports manual approval of drafts
- sends approved emails automatically
- updates status and tab colors
- removes duplicates
- runs continuously with self-recovery behavior

## Core Architecture
Current core layers:

1. Lead Generator
2. CRM Layer (Google Sheets)
3. Email Generator Layer
4. Email Sender Engine
5. Polisher / Integrity Engine

Planned layers:

1. Reply Monitor
2. Follow-Up Engine
3. Autonomous Agent Controller

## CRM Specification (Google Sheets)
- Spreadsheet ID: `1HtJrN7o1-8prbt6wQUHupoKdjO_ARAlwnZAQrbqe0xc`
- Primary tab: `Master`

### Master Columns
1. `Name`
2. `City`
3. `Category`
4. `Email`
5. `Status`

### Allowed Status Values
- `Drafted`
- `Approved`
- `Sent`
- `Replied` (future)
- `Invalid` (future)
- `Follow-up` (future)

## Individual Business Tabs
Each business has a tab named exactly as the business name (example: `True D'sign Landscaping LLC`).

Tab columns:

1. `Name`
2. `City`
3. `Category`
4. `Email`
5. `Status`
6. `About`
7. `Email Message`

Field locations:

- email message body: cell `A11`
- status: cell `E2`

## Workflow State Machine
Progression:

`Drafted -> Approved -> Sent -> Replied (future)`

### `Drafted`
- created by lead generator
- email generated
- waiting for manual approval

### `Approved`
- manually approved by user
- sender engine auto-detects this state
- email is sent automatically

### `Sent`
- email delivered successfully
- lead must never be sent again

## Tab Color Mapping
Color is set with Google Sheets API `batchUpdate`.

- `Drafted` -> red `{ "red": 0.8, "green": 0, "blue": 0 }`
- `Approved` -> black `{ "red": 0, "green": 0, "blue": 0 }`
- `Sent` -> green `{ "red": 0, "green": 0.8, "blue": 0 }`

## Email Sending Layer (Brevo)
- Provider: Brevo (Sendinblue)
- Endpoint: `https://api.brevo.com/v3/smtp/email`
- Auth header: `api-key`

Sender identity:

- Name: `Evergreen Media Labs`
- Address: `evergreen.labs@outlook.com`

Email details:

- Subject: `Student Partnership`
- Body: loaded from sheet cell `A11`

Sending rule:

- send only when `status == Approved`

Post-send updates:

- update `Master` status to `Sent`
- update individual tab status to `Sent`
- set tab color to green

## Lead Generator Specification
Sources:

- Google Maps
- web directories

Categories:

- Lawn care
- Landscaping
- House cleaning
- Pressure washing
- Mobile detailing
- Junk removal
- Handyman
- Gutter cleaning
- Window cleaning
- Snow removal
- Fence installation
- Deck building
- Concrete contractors
- Tree removal
- Roofing
- Moving services
- Painting contractors
- HVAC repair
- Appliance repair
- Pool cleaning

Target cities:

- Wausau
- Stevens Point
- Merrill
- Marshfield
- Antigo
- Weston
- Hatley

Lead validity requirements:

- must include business name
- must include email
- must not already exist in CRM
- website-missing preference (optional)

## Polisher / Integrity Engine
Duplicate rule:

- duplicate if `Name` matches OR `Email` matches

Duplicate action:

- delete duplicate row from `Master`
- delete duplicate individual tab

Also runs tab color synchronization:

- reads `Master`
- applies tab color per status mapping each cycle

## Approval Sync Rule
Individual tab status overrides `Master`.

If individual tab `E2` becomes `Approved`:

- `Master` status is automatically updated to `Approved`

## Sender Engine Loop
Cycle:

1. Read `Master` once
2. Run polisher
3. Sync approvals
4. Find first `Approved` lead
5. Send email
6. Update status to `Sent`
7. Update tab color
8. Sleep 60-120 seconds
9. Repeat

If no approved leads:

- sleep and retry

## Google Sheets Authentication
Uses service account in `credentials.json`:

- `client_email`
- `private_key`
- `project_id`

Service account must have Editor access to the spreadsheet.

## API Quota Strategy
Constraint:

- Google Sheets API is rate-limited (around 60 reads/min/user)

Optimization:

- read `Master` once per cycle
- avoid repeated reads for same data
- use cached in-cycle values

## Email Generation Layer (OpenAI)
Draft emails are generated with OpenAI API.

Generation requirements:

- humble student entrepreneur tone
- professional and warm
- personalized
- no placeholders
- no generic template language
- mention business category
- mention Google rating if `>= 3`
- offer website build service
- ask for reply if interested

Required signature:

`Thank you,`

`Owner of Evergreen Media Labs`

## Manual Approval Requirement
- drafts are never auto-sent on creation
- human reviews draft first
- human sets status to `Approved`
- sender engine auto-processes approved leads

## Autonomous Runtime Requirements
System must:

- never resend same lead
- never duplicate lead
- recover from transient errors
- avoid permanent crashes
- respect send intervals
- respect Google API quota

## Current Operational State
Currently functional:

- lead generation
- CRM integration
- email generation
- email sending
- approval sync
- polisher
- duplicate prevention

## Planned Features
### Reply Detection
- monitor inbox for replies
- when reply detected, mark status `Replied`

### Follow-Up Engine
- send follow-up after 5 days if no reply

### Bounce Detection
- mark invalid emails automatically

### Unified Controller
- single master controller process orchestrates all components

## Security Requirements
Sensitive secrets:

- `credentials.json` (Google service account)
- Brevo API key
- OpenAI API key

Never expose secrets publicly.

## Current File Structure (Observed/Expected)
- `credentials.json`
- `sender11.py`
- agent files
- lead generator scripts
- Google Apps Script bridge

## Design Philosophy
Human role is intentionally minimal:

- review drafts
- approve leads

All other operations are automated.

## Intended Final Component Tree
Controller Agent

- Lead Generator
- CRM Manager
- Email Generator
- Polisher
- Sender
- Reply Monitor
- Follow-up Engine

## Codex Maintenance Rules
Any future Codex changes must:

- avoid excessive API reads
- prevent duplicates
- preserve CRM data integrity
- never resend sent leads
- preserve sheet structure
- preserve status logic/state machine
- remain safe for 24/7 operation
